The kernel validates all of read(2)'s arguments using the functions argfd(),
argint(), and argptr(). If any of these functions reports an error, the read(2)
call fails immediately. The argptr() function checks whether the memory range
supplied by the process falls within its address space.

Conveniently, the argptr() function is able to check that the process has
permission to access entire specified region, and therefore no further checks
are needed in the fileread() function. This is possible because the argint()
function validates and parses the size argument, providing it to argptr().

Using this simplifying approach, sys_read() detects both bad pointers and
over-long reads in one condition.
